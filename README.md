# Face Recognition Project

This Python project implements face recognition functionality, allowing the program to recognize faces from images, videos, or through the live webcam of the system. It utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and recognize faces with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images, videos, or live webcam streams using pre-trained face detection models.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes faces by comparing detected faces with a pre-trained database of known faces.
- **Real-time Recognition**: Provides real-time face recognition capabilities through the live webcam feed.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes deep learning-based face recognition algorithms for accurate and robust recognition.
- **Flexible Input**: Supports various input sources including images, videos, and live webcam streams.
- **User Interface**: Optionally provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction and visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `OpenCV` for image and video processing
  - `dlib` for face detection and recognition
  - `face_recognition` library for face recognition
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
- **Deep Learning Framework**:
  - Optionally, `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` can be used for training custom face recognition models.
- **GUI Framework** (optional):
  - `Tkinter`, `PyQt`, or `wxPython` for building a graphical user interface (GUI) if desired.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd face-recognition`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. If using a deep learning framework for training custom models, follow their respective installation instructions.

## Usage

1. Run the main Python script: `python main.py`.
2. Choose the desired input source (image, video, or webcam).
3. If necessary, provide the path to the input file.
4. The program will detect and recognize faces from the input source and display the results.
5. Optionally, interact with the graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
